# Use Cases for Enhanced Animal Collection System 

### Use Case 01: Create Animal Class with Encapsulation

**As a developer**
</br>**I want** animals represented as objects with a class definition
</br>**So that** data and behavior are encapsulated in a proper OOP structure

# Use Case 02: Initialize Animal with Constructor Parameters

**As a developer**
</br>**I want** animals created with named parameters
</br>**So that** initialization is explicit and flexible

### Use Case 03: Auto-Generate Unique Animal IDs

**As a system**
</br>**I want** each animal to receive a unique sequential ID
</br>**So that** animals can be uniquely identified

### Use Case 04: Implement ID Property with Getter/Setter

**As a developer**
</br>**I want** ID managed through a property
</br>**So that** ID access is controlled and consistent

### Use Case 05: Implement Colour Property with Validation

**As a system**
</br>**I want** colour validated and formatted when set
</br>**So that** only valid colours in standard format are stored

### Use Case 06: Implement Limb Count Property with Range Validation

**As a system**
</br>**I want** limb count validated to be non-negative
</br>**So that** impossible limb counts are prevented

### Use Case 07: Implement Eat Method for Animal Behaviour

**As a developer**
</br>**I want** animals to have an eat behavior method
</br>**So that** eating logic is encapsulated in the Animal class

### Use Case 08: Implement Move Method for Animal Behaviour

**As a developer**
</br>**I want** animals to have a move behavior method
</br>**So that** movement capabilities can be simulated

### Use Case 09: Refactor load_animals to Create Animal Objects

**As a system**
</br>**I want** pre-loaded animals created as Animal instances
</br>**So that** initial data uses the new class structure

### Use Case 10: Refactor add_animal to Create Animal Objects

**As a system**
</br>**I want** new animals created as Animal instances
</br>**So that** user-added animals use the class structure

### Use Case 11: Refactor edit_animal to Use Object Properties

**As a developer**
</br>**I want** edit operations to modify object properties
</br>**So that** editing works with the Animal class

### Use Case 12: Refactor remove_animal to Use Object Properties

**As a developer**
</br>**I want** remove operations to access object properties
</br>**So that** removal messages use the Animal class

### Use Case 13: Refactor feed_animal to Use Object Methods and Properties

**As a developer**
</br>**I want** feed operations to use Animal's eat method
</br>**So that** eating behavior is encapsulated in the class
